# kubernetes-rsyslog-logging

Centralized container logs with rsyslog server and Linux logger.

## purpose

Provide kubernetes configuration to establish a centralized logging solution. Tested with minikube and kubernetes 1.8

* rsyslog server that takes logs and writes them to a log file for each host that sends logs.
* example for a Docker container with overwritten command that sends it's log to the rsyslog server.

## setup

Start [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)

```s
minikube start
```

### server

Deploy rsyslog server with service.

```s
kubectl create -f rsyslog-server-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f rsyslog-server-service.yaml
```

Log files will be written to */var/log*

Rsyslog container is pulled from [jumanjiman/rsyslog](https://hub.docker.com/r/jumanjiman/rsyslog/).
Which is build on this base: <https://github.com/jumanjihouse/docker-rsyslog>

#### logging configuration

Rsyslog configuration is overwritten by a config map.
See the server deployment: [rsyslog-server-deployment.yaml](./rsyslog-server-deployment.yaml)

### example application

Random logging container.

Configuration shows how to extend the run command. Original command from the Dockerfile is ```/entrypoint.sh```

Command with logging: ```/entrypoint.sh  2>&1 | logger -s 2>&1```

* Collect *stdout* and *stderr* from entrypoint command and pipe them to the logger.
* Logger writes to syslog and also to *stdout* becaus of the *-s* flag.
* Additional, the rsyslog server has to be configured.
  * See the container deployment for the final solution: [rsyslog-example-app.yaml](./rsyslog-example-app.yaml)

Important: Create example application after the service.

```s
kubectl create -f rsyslog-example-app.yaml
```

## log rotation

Log rotation is needed to not fill the disk space.

Add this sidecar container: <https://hub.docker.com/r/blacklabelops/logrotate/>
